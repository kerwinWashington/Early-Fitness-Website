<h2>Which workout will you choose?</h2>
<article>

<h2>Push Ups</h2>
<p>
Pushups are one of the most common at home workouts that anyone can try. Even if you do not have 
enough upper body strength to perform regular pushups there are alternatives that can be performed. 
To begin, get down on the floor with your hands shoulder width apart, arms fully extended and your 
toes on the ground. From here lower your chest towards the ground until you touch and then push your 
chest back up with your arms. To view an example click here. For an alternative for those with less 
strength, instead of starting with your toes on the floor, start with your knees touching the floor 
to ease the stress on your upper body. To view an example click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IODxDxX7oi4">here</a>.

<h2>Sit Ups</h2>
<p>
Sit ups are a great at home ab workout. To perform a sit up, start with your back on the floor and bend your 
knees until your heels are about 12-18 inches from your lower torso. Next cross your arms 
(or put your fingers behind your ears) and curl your head towards your knees where you should feel the 
contraction within your abs. To view an example click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WSon5E798w">here</a>.

<h2>Squats</h2>
<p>Squats are a great leg work out that involves a lot of the muscles in the leg. 
Normally this is done in gym with various types of weighted equipment but they can 
also be turned into a body weight exercise. To start, stand straight up with feet 
shoulder width apart. From here lower your torso down bending your knees and 
flexing your hips until your upper legs are parallel to the floor or a little lower 
depending on flexibility. From here, return to the starting position. To view an example click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aclHkVaku9U"> here</a>.

Burpees are a great cardiovascular workout that involves numerous muscles in the body. To start,

<h2>Gallon of Water Curls</h2>
<p>
This workout only requires a gallon of water jug or two if you feel so inclined.
The purpose of this workout is to act the same as a normal bicep curl but instead 
of using a dumbell you use a gallon of water. Start by grabbing the gallon jug with your arm 
by your side and simply curling your hand up until your hand is just above your elbow or nearly to your 
shoulder. By using a gallon jug, you can add or subtract water in order to vary the weight.
