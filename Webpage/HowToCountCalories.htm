<h3>Lets Learn How to Track Some Food</h3>
<article>
<p> 
Tracking food can be a tedious and somewhat annoying process 
but it can be one of the most useful ways to lose weight and
 to know exactly what you are putting into your body.

<h2>Where To Start...Again?</h2>

<p>
The best place to start is to download the mobile application <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/"> MyFitnessPal.com.</a> 
This free app is a widely used tool for many people to track their weight,
 food and water consumption on their road to reaching their goals. There
 are numerous other food tracking applications but this one is by far my favorite.

<h2>Weighing Food <img class="floatright" src="media/foodscale.jpg" alt="Food Scale"></h2>
<p>
After creating a new account, the next step is to purchase a food scale to weight your foods. 
The food scale will allow you to properly know the portions that you are making and what to type 
into the MyFitnessPal app. You can choose between Ounces and Grams depending on which unit of 
measurement you prefer. For example, if you wanted to weigh out 50oz of blueberries you would set 
a bowl onto the scale zero-out the scale with the bowl on it then simply add in the 50oz of blueberries 
until the scale tells you your magic number. This concept can be used for almost any food group.
 Fortunate for people who like snacks, the app can use your camera to snapshot the bar code on the 
back of the bag/ box to automatically put in the calories.

<h2>Nutrition Facts </h2>
<img src="media/nutrition.png" alt="Nutrition">
<p>On the back of almost every label that you purchase at the grocery store there is a Nutrition Facts label. 
This label will tell you exactly how many calories are in a single serving of the product that you just purchased. 
Use the serving size information to estimate exactly how much of the product you are consuming in order to calculate 
the total calories of the serving and/ or meal. This label will also tell you exactly how much protein, carbohydrates, 
total fats, and other nutrients are in every serving. The MyFitnessPal app can also fill all of this in by taking a snapshot of the barcode.

<h2>Macro Nutrients</h2>
<p>
Macro nutrients are the larger nutrients that you will consume in your day to day diet. The main macro nutrients 
that you will be calculating in the MyFitnessPal app will be proteins, carbohydrates and fats. Most of your proteins 
will come from meats or bean like foods, most of the carbohydrates will come from starchy vegetables and sprouts and 
fats will come from oils or certain vegetables. A good rule of thumb from calculating total calories is to strive for 
calculating total macronutrients, this will almost even out but is not so easy the other way around.
