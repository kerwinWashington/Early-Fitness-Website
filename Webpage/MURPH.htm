<h2>What is the MURPH?</h2>
<p>
The MURPH is an advanced cross fit workout that focuses on endurance as much as it
 does on being one of the most difficult workouts out there. This can be done at home,
 in a gym, or supplemented with the equipment available which only requires a pull up 
bar and a 20 pound vest if so desired.

<h2>Where it came from</h2>
<p>
The MURPH is a workout that is done in remembrance of LT Michael Murphy who was killed 
in action in Afghanistan on June 28th, 2005. This was a workout that he would constantly 
perform, originally, called “Body Armor”, which was renamed after him a few years later in 
reembrace of him. Hundreds of Americans will perform this workout on Memorial Day weekend 
as a testament to remember LT. Murphy and other countless Americans who have given their 
lives in the service of their country.

<h2>To perform the workout participants must perform:</h2>
<p>
1 mile run<br>
100 pull ups<br>
200 push ups<br>
300 squats<br> 
1 mile run<br>
</p>

<h2>Performing the workout</h2>
<p>
Some people choose to perform this workout while wearing a 20 pound vest,
 much like LT. Murphy did, and will also complete it for time. So far the
 records have been around 30 minutes by advanced athletes. Participants do
 not have to perform this workout for time, as some wish to test their endurance 
and physicality. Additionally, there are substitutions that can be done if the 
participant does not have to required equipment or fitness level. Instead of 
performing 100 pull ups, 400 sit ups can be substituted, 500 jumping jacks can be 
substituted for the 1 mile run, and if the participant cannot perform this high volume 
everything can be divided in half.
