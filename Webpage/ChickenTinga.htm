<h2>Chicken Tinga</h2>
<p>
This page contains the recipe for one of my favorite chicken/ taco recipes. 
This recipe is a great protein source and is also a good veggie source. 
Once the meal is done the chicken can even be added to taco or tortilla shells 
for a good taco Tuesday dinner.

1 pound of chicken<br> 
4 plum tomatoes<br>
1 large onion<br>

First start with boiling the chicken in either the chicken broth or bouillon, 
enough to cover the chicken (for bouillon just mix into the water and add the chicken). 
Once this is done, shred the chicken by pulling it apart into little shreds and save for 
later. Next clean and chop the tomatoes and add them into a blender along with the canned 
chipotle, one clove of garlic, pepper and 1 cup of the broth reserve. Blend until smooth.

<h2>Vegetables</h2>
<p>
Slice the onion and the remaining cloves and stir fry them in a skillet or pan on medium-low 
heat until with the olive oil until the onions become slightly golden which is about 4 minutes. 
Next, turn the heat to medium, add the sauce from the blender for about another 5 minutes. 
Lastly add the chicken into the sauce and allow to cook an additional 20 minutes on simmer to allow 
the chicken to absorb and add salt as desired.

<h2>Serving</h2>
<p>
To serve you can either add it as a topping on to rice, more vegetables or taco shells, 
tortillas or burritos. Preparation time normally takes about 1 hour but it last for several 
days or can make about 4-8 servings. Very easy recipe and all it takes is a cutting board, knife,
 blender and a pot with a possible skillet for that stir fried taste.
