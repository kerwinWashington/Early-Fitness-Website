<h3>Is your answer maybe?</h3>
<article>
<p> Many people are stuck in the house during the COVID-19 pandemic 
and may be starting to become extremely bored with their new sedentary lifestyle but
just because you are stuck in the house does not mean that you cannot be physical 
or start making healthy lifestyle changes. This page contains information on things that 
you can do while you are stuck in the house that can make a change for the better.
</p>



<h2>Where To Start</h2>

<p>The best place to start for making healthy changes while stuck 
in the house is to straighten up your living domicile. By doing this
 you are not only getting the blood flowing, but you are also allowing 
yourself to have room to think, grow and begin any of the next tasks.   </p>

<h2>Getting in the Kitchen</h2>
<p>Now with your newly renovated household, you may have either worked up an 
appetite or just want to start working on eating healthier in order to feel
 better. Eating healthy is a good way to feel better and be creative in 
the kitchen. 
<a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/healthy/packages/healthy-every-week/healthy-mains/foodnetwork-most-saved-healthy-recipes"> Foodnetwork.com</a> 
is a great place to start for looking up healthy 
recipes to create in the kitchen. But if you are not too fond of cooking gourmet meals, a
good rule of thumb for prepping meals is to make a third of a the plate some form of protein, 
a third a starchy carb, and a third filled with veggies. For a great chicken tinga recipe quick <a href="ChickenTinga.htm">here</a>.

<h2>Getting Active</h2>
<p>Just because you do not have a gym membership or it may be closed doesnt mean that 
you cannot get active in your own home. Doing yoga, sets of pushups, situps,
 or even going for a nice easy job are great ways of practice good physical fitness. Not 
only will you feel good but sometimes the results that you gain may surprise you. 
Below are a few good examples of these four activities.

<h2>Rest</h2>
<p>
Whether you are stuck in the house due to COVID-19 or you have a normal daily routine, 
getting the proper amount of rest is key to living a healthy lifestyle. Most professionals 
recommend trying to get between 6-8 hours of uninterrupted sleep. During sleeping hours
is when the body does most of its recovering from daily activities. 
It is also recommended to enforce a sleep schedule to optimize rest and recovery.
